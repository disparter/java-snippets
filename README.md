[![Modules to Github Release](https://github.com/disparter/java-snippets/actions/workflows/manual.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/disparter/java-snippets/actions/workflows/manual.yml)

## Summary
This repository is part of my self educate series, that begins in 2021.


## self_suficient_snippets

All java files in this folder can be run without the need of anything else
because they are sole files, some patterns are hard to be noted and this files are hard to be reused

## src

In this folder modules are declared to be able to be reused.
The classes are designed with simple purporese based on SOLID


### Example
The PredicateSnippet is a filter that prints only a type of object
    in the module version it uses a SimpleObject witch is an object with a String object, have unittest to guarantee for future modifications
    in the self_suficient example it uses Strings and have a main inside it, there is no guarantee of the test
