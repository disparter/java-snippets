## Snippets for Java
This repository is part of my self-educate series, which begins in 2021.

### self_suficient_snippets
All java files in this folder can be run without the need of anything else because they are sole files, some patterns are hard to be noted and these files are hard to be reused

#### src
In this folder, modules are declared to be able to be reused. The classes are designed with simple purpose based on SOLID

#### Example
The PredicateSnippet is a filter that prints only a type of object in the module version it uses a SimpleObject which is an object with a String object, have a unit test to guarantee for future modifications in the self_suficient example it uses Strings and has a main inside it, there is no guarantee of the test
